# MazeMeander

You are the mouse. Can you find all the cheeses?

This was my first large web game to teach myself Javascript and JQuery. (I was a sophomore at the time and so I didn't have great coding practices when I created this game)

It is a game where you are a mouse trying to collect all of the cheeses in a classic maze. The catch is that even though the view is from above, the player can only see what the mouse can see. There are 20 levels of learning to use keys, portals, and pipes to find cheese and avoid cats with three different levels of AI's. There is also a maze maker that allows for point and click creation of levels.
